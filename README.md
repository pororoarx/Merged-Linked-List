# Merged-Linked-List
The program aims to merge two linked lists, each representing a sequence of integers sorted in non-decreasing order. The objective is to create a new linked list that is sorted by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists. The output should be a single linked list, maintaining the sorted order of the input sequences.

## How to Use?
1. Install Python on your machine
2. Clone the repository (git clone "git@github.com:pororoarx/Merged-Linked-List.git")

## Run the Program
1. Run "merged_linked_list.py"
2. The program will ask you to input elements separated by space for the first linked list. The process will repeat for the second linked list.
3. For the output, the program will display the original linked lists and the merged linked list.

Example:
<pre>
Enter elements for the first linked list
Enter elements separated by space: 1 3 5

Enter elements for the second linked list
Enter elements separated by space: 2 4 6

List 1: 1 -> 2 -> 4
List 2: 1 -> 3 -> 4

Merged Linked List: 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4
</pre>
