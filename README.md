# Merged-Linked-List
The program aims to merge two linked lists, each representing a sequence of integers sorted in non-decreasing order. The objective is to create a new linked list that is sorted by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists. The output should be a single linked list, maintaining the sorted order of the input sequences.
